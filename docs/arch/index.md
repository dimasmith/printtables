# Printtables architecture

This is an architecture documentation for the project.

The documentation is not intended to be extensive and complete, as the project is very small.
However, given the fact that the development will be sporadic, some supporting documentation might be useful.

## Overview

The [system context](context/containers.md) document provides and overview of system components and their role.
It is a good entry point to understand how and why the system is structured like it is.

When making project decisions it's good to evaluate it against a current [quality attributes](quality-attributes/utility-tree.md).

Looking through the past decisions is beneficial for establishing context.
Check the [decision log](../decisions/index.md) for ADRs.
