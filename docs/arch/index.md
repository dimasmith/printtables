# Printtables architecture

This is an architecture documentation for the project.

The documentation is not intended to be extensive and complete, as the project is very small.
However, given the fact that the development will be sporadic, some supporting documentation might be useful.

## Overview

The [system context](context/containers.md) document provides and overview of system components and their role.
It is a good entry point to understand how and why the system is structured like it is.

In the [components view](./components/components.md) we dive into the structure of the API service. The internal structure is very volatile in this stage. The component view lists some concerns and provides a rationale for the current approach.

The [quality attributes](quality-attributes/utility-tree.md) section lists the applicable quality attributes and evaluates their relevance. The utility tree in this section should be used to evaluate solutions and justify decisions.

Looking through the past decisions is beneficial for establishing context.
Check the [decision log](../decisions/index.md) for ADRs.
