# ADR-0001: Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Decision Tracking

Status: `Accepted`
Date: `2024-10-19`

## Context

In the initial stages of this project, we need a structured and transparent way to document and track key architectural and technical decisions. This is particularly important for maintaining a clear record of why certain decisions were made, especially as the project grows and more team members are involved. As the architecture evolves, it becomes crucial to ensure that future developers and stakeholders can understand the reasoning behind previous decisions.

## Problem

Without a standardized approach to documenting decisions, we risk losing important context, rationale, and details that can lead to confusion, technical debt, or even the reversal of well-thought-out decisions. Key issues that arise from not having proper documentation include:

- Lack of visibility into why certain architectural choices were made.
- Difficulty onboarding new team members or external contributors.
- Inconsistent decision-making across teams or time.
- Increased time spent retracing the steps to understand previous technical directions.

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as the formal mechanism for capturing and documenting important architectural and technical decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

Key attributes of this decision include:

- Template Standardization: Every ADR will follow a consistent format (such as this one), ensuring clarity and uniformity.
- Incremental Numbering: ADRs will be numbered sequentially, starting with ADR-0001, to indicate the order of decisions.
- Version Control: ADRs will be stored in the project's version control system (e.g., Git) to ensure traceability and easy access.
- Decision Scope: ADRs will focus on high-level architecture decisions, though key technical and operational decisions may also be documented as necessary.
- Living Documentation: ADRs will remain active documents that can be revisited and updated over time as the project evolves.

## Options Considered

- Use of ADRs: As described, ADRs provide a lightweight yet formalized approach to document architectural decisions.
- Informal Documentation (Meeting Notes, Wikis): While easier to implement, informal documentation lacks the structured approach needed for long-term traceability and consistency.
- No Formal Documentation: Relying on team knowledge and verbal communication can lead to misunderstandings and loss of context over time.

## Decision Outcome

We chose to adopt ADRs for the following reasons:

- Traceability: ADRs will provide a historical record of all significant architecture-related decisions.
- Collaboration: The process encourages collaboration by allowing decisions to be reviewed and revisited in a structured way.
- Standardization: ADRs create a consistent format for capturing decisions, making them easier to track and share.

The alternative options (informal documentation and no formal documentation) were rejected due to the risks they posed in terms of clarity, transparency, and scalability.
Consequences

- Positive:
  - Enhanced clarity and transparency regarding architectural decisions.
  - Easier onboarding of new developers who can refer to ADRs for historical context.
  - Better communication and alignment across teams, especially in distributed environments.
- Negative:
  - Time and effort will be required to maintain ADRs, especially as decisions evolve.
  - There may be some initial resistance from team members who are not accustomed to formalized documentation practices.
  - Revisions to ADRs will require careful management to ensure updates are properly tracked and communicated.

Next Steps

- Introduce the ADR process to the development team and provide guidelines on how to create and maintain ADRs.
- Set up a dedicated folder or repository within version control to store ADRs.
- Review this ADR in three months to assess how the process is working and whether any adjustments are needed.
