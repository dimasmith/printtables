# Printtables DevLog

Welcome to the DevLog!

It is a collection of notes on the project reflecting on issues, decisions and obstacles we have.

First and foremost the `printtables` is a Rust programming exercise. 
So the notes here, we hope, will be helpful as a source of troubleshooting and establishing decisions context.
